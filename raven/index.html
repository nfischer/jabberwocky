<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"'T is some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Only this, and nothing more."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Eagerly I wished the morrow:&ndash;vainly I had sought to borrow</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">From my books <span class="term">surcease</span> of sorrow&ndash;sorrow for the lost <span class="term">Lenore</span>&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <span class="term">Lenore</span>&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Nameless here for evermore.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Thrilled me&ndash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">This it is, and nothing more."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">That I scarce was sure I heard you"&ndash;here I opened wide the door;&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Darkness there, and nothing more.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "<span class="term">Lenore</span>!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "<span class="term">Lenore</span>!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Merely this and nothing more.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">'T is the wind and nothing more!"</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Not the least <span class="term">obeisance</span> made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">But, with <span class="term">mien</span> of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Perched upon a bust of <span class="term">Pallas</span> just above my chamber door&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Then this ebony bird <span class="term">beguiling</span> my sad fancy into smiling,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">By the grave and stern decorum of the <span class="term">countenance</span> it wore,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no <span class="term">craven</span>,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's <span class="term">Plutonian</span> shore!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line"><span class="term">Quoth</span> the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Though its answer little meaning&ndash;little relevancy bore;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">With such name as "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">But the Raven, sitting lonely on the <span class="term">placid</span> bust, spoke only</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Nothing further then he uttered&ndash;not a feather then he fluttered&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Till the <span class="term">dirges</span> of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Of 'Never&ndash;nevermore.'"</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">But the Raven still <span class="term">beguiling</span> all my sad soul into smiling,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">She shall press, ah, nevermore!</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Swung by <span class="term">seraphim</span> whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee&ndash;by these angels he hath sent thee</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Respite&ndash;respite and <span class="term">nepenthe</span> from thy memories of <span class="term">Lenore</span>!</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line"><span class="term"><span class="term">Quaff</span></span>, oh <span class="term">quaff</span> this kind <span class="term">nepenthe</span>, and forget this lost <span class="term">Lenore</span>!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line"><span class="term">Quoth</span> the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!&ndash;prophet still, if bird or devil!&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">On this home by Horror haunted&ndash;tell me truly, I implore&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Is there&ndash;is there <span class="term">balm in Gilead</span>?&ndash;tell me&ndash;tell me, I implore!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line"><span class="term">Quoth</span> the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil&ndash;prophet still, if bird or devil!</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">By that Heaven that bends above, us&ndash;by that God we both adore&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant <span class="term">Aidenn</span>,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <span class="term">Lenore</span>&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <span class="term">Lenore</span>."</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line"><span class="term">Quoth</span> the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting&ndash;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's <span class="term">Plutonian</span> shore!</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Leave my loneliness unbroken!&ndash;quit the bust above my door!</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line"><span class="term">Quoth</span> the Raven, "Nevermore."</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="stanza-first-line">And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">On the <span class="term">pallid</span> bust of <span class="term">Pallas</span> just above my chamber door;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</span><br>
<span class="stanza-line">And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</span><br>
<span class="stanza-last-line">Shall be lifted&ndash;nevermore!</span><br>
