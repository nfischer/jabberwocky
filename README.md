# Jabberwocky

A collection of interactive poems. Hover over bold terms to see link hints
defining them.

## Browser support

Tested against Google Chrome, Firefox, and iOS Safari. On mobile, you'll have to
tap the bold term, since the browser doesn't have a good notion of hovering.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding alternate definitions in `definitions.js` for
the poem of your choice. If there's only one definition for your term, turn the
string into an array of multiple definitions.
