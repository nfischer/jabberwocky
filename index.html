<p>
`Twas <span>brillig</span>, and the <span>slithy</span> <span>toves</span><br>
Did <span>gyre</span> and <span>gimble</span> in the <span>wabe</span>:<br>
All <span>mimsy</span> were the <span>borogoves</span>,<br>
And the <span>mome</span> <span>raths</span> <span>outgrabe</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Beware the <span>Jabberwock</span>, my son!<br>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the <span>Jubjub</span> bird, and shun<br>
The <span>frumious</span> <span>Bandersnatch</span>!"<br>
</p>

<p>
He took his <span>vorpal</span> sword in hand:<br>
Long time the <span>manxome</span> foe he sought --<br>
So rested he by the <span>Tumtum</span> tree,<br>
And stood awhile in thought.<br>
</p>

<p>
And, as in <span>uffish</span> thought he stood,<br>
The <span>Jabberwock</span>, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came <span>whiffling</span> through the <span>tulgey</span> wood,<br>
And <span>burbled</span> as it came!<br>
</p>

<p>
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br>
The <span>vorpal</span> blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went <span>galumphing</span> back.<br>
</p>

<p>
"And, has thou slain the <span>Jabberwock</span>?<br>
Come to my arms, my <span>beamish</span> boy!<br>
O <span>frabjous</span> day!  <span>Callooh</span>!  <span>Callay</span>!'<br>
He <span>chortled</span> in his joy.<br>
</p>

<p>
`Twas <span>brillig</span>, and the <span>slithy</span> <span>toves</span><br>
Did <span>gyre</span> and <span>gimble</span> in the <span>wabe</span>;<br>
All <span>mimsy</span> were the <span>borogoves</span>,<br>
And the <span>mome</span> <span>raths</span> <span>outgrabe</span>.<br>
