`Twas <span class="term">brillig</span>, and the <span class="term">slithy</span> <span class="term">toves</span><br>
Did <span class="term">gyre</span> and <span class="term">gimble</span> in the <span class="term">wabe</span>:<br>
All <span class="term">mimsy</span> were the <span class="term">borogoves</span>,<br>
And the <span class="term">mome</span> <span class="term">raths</span> <span class="term">outgrabe</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Beware the <span class="term">Jabberwock</span>, my son!<br>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the <span class="term">Jubjub</span> bird, and shun<br>
The <span class="term">frumious</span> <span class="term">Bandersnatch</span>!"<br>
</p>

<p>
He took his <span class="term">vorpal</span> sword in hand:<br>
Long time the <span class="term">manxome</span> foe he sought --<br>
So rested he by the <span class="term">Tumtum</span> tree,<br>
And stood awhile in thought.<br>
</p>

<p>
And, as in <span class="term">uffish</span> thought he stood,<br>
The <span class="term">Jabberwock</span>, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came <span class="term">whiffling</span> through the <span class="term">tulgey</span> wood,<br>
And <span class="term">burbled</span> as it came!<br>
</p>

<p>
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br>
The <span class="term">vorpal</span> blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went <span class="term">galumphing</span> back.<br>
</p>

<p>
"And, has thou slain the <span class="term">Jabberwock</span>?<br>
Come to my arms, my <span class="term">beamish</span> boy!<br>
O <span class="term">frabjous</span> day!  <span class="term">Callooh</span>!  <span class="term">Callay</span>!'<br>
He <span class="term">chortled</span> in his joy.<br>
</p>

<p>
`Twas <span class="term">brillig</span>, and the <span class="term">slithy</span> <span class="term">toves</span><br>
Did <span class="term">gyre</span> and <span class="term">gimble</span> in the <span class="term">wabe</span>;<br>
All <span class="term">mimsy</span> were the <span class="term">borogoves</span>,<br>
And the <span class="term">mome</span> <span class="term">raths</span> <span class="term">outgrabe</span>.<br>
